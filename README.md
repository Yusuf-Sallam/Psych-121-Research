# Psych-121-Research
This is an overview of the research my group and I explored in our Psychology 121 class. We looked at the relationship of color on memory and recall. 


**Introduction** <br>
This study explores how font color affected memory function. The three font color
conditions employed in the within-subjects experimental design were black, red-black, and
green-black. In a free recall test, participants (N=30) were asked to recall as many terms as they
could after being shown a list of 12 words. The notion that a change in font color improves recall
was not supported by the results. Gender and font color did, however, interact significantly, with
women recalling more words than men under the color-changing settings. This study adds to the
body of knowledge about how color affects memory and emphasizes the need for more research
into how gender affects memory function.
