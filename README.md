# Psych-121-Research
This is an overview of the research my group and I explored in our Psychology 121 class. We looked at the relationship of color on memory and recall. 


**Introduction** <br>
Marketing tactics employ a variety of strategies in order to win consumer’s attention and increase sales. One specific strategy includes manipulating color to produce the most bold and eye-catching advertisement. Interestingly, color contrast or a change in color significantly enhances consumers’ ability to recall advertisements (Donthu et al.,1993). Researchers found that changing background color when presenting words to participants induces a significant context effect thus increasing the total number of words recalled (Isarida & Isarida, 2007). Another factor which influences an advertisement’s ability to be recalled is the association between color and emotion. Research has shown that positively associated colors like green are able to positively enhance participants’ mood (Kaya & Epps, 2004). Conversely, negatively associated colors like red produce an opposite effect. In terms of marketing, the positive or negative mood produced by strategically selected colors may enhance consumer’s recall. Furthermore, this study was designed to fill the holes in research and establish the relationship between font color and memory. As mentioned earlier, there is a significant effect between color and memory such that a change in color enhances memory. However, not much research has been conducted on this effect with the use of font color. This study aims to determine if a change in font color enhances memory. More specifically, we will examine the influence of positive and negative color associations through the use of a font color change on memory. 


**Hypothesis** <br>
Trials which contain a color change between words will influence memory. Subjects will recall more words of a list when there is a change in color between words versus conditions where the words are uniformly colored. Additionally, because of the negative influence of emotion associated with the color red, we predict that trials where the color shifts from black to red, will significantly enhance memory and recall of words.


**Methods** <br>
**Participants** <br>
We intend to use the opportunity sampling method to recruit UCLA undergraduate students. Researchers will kindly ask their acquaintances at UCLA to participate by providing detailed research descriptions and informed consent in digital form. The sample size consists of 100 student subjects aged from 18 to 24. We will screen all participants to ensure subjects were not diagnosed with any color blindness before. Also, the experiment will be conducted only on those who answered that there was nothing wrong with their vision. The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (black-red and black-green), and each group will have 50 valid participants. 


**Instruments** <br>
In this between-subjects experimental research design, the independent variable is font color. The study looks at the following three font colors: black; red, which is associated with negative emotions; and green, which is associated with positive emotions. 
The dependent variable is memory, which is tested using a free recall test. Participants will be shown a list of words, then tested on the number of words they can recall via a free recall test. If more words are recalled in one condition when compared to another, a significant effect in memory can be deduced. In order to control for order effects, the study uses randomization of the order of the words and color-changing conditions. The words will be simple nouns that are presented for three seconds to participants. The study also includes control conditions, such as background color. By using a controlled experimental design and considering various factors that can affect the results, the study aims to test the effects of font color on memory performance in a rigorous and systematic way.


**Procedure** <br>
Participants will be given a Qualtrics link to a project. Before starting, they will complete a consent form and confirm that they have normal vision and perception for color. Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of six conditions. This means one of three levels of font color and one of the two groups of words. For example, condition one would be the black color condition with the first group of word while condition two would be the black and green color condition with the second group of word. Once they click start, they will be presented with words one by one on the screen for three seconds each. There will be 20 words total before they will be moved onto the recall page. The recall screen has a text box that will allow the participants to type in as many words as they remember in 5 minutes. 
We will compare the average recall words for each condition. We will perform a one-way ANOVA to analyze the data.
